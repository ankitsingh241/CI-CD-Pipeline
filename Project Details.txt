In this lab will see how to deploy a website using Docker and Jenkins pipeline project.

Step 1 : Create a linux server and clone the app or repository using command
         
         --> sudo git clone [link of the repo]

Step 2 : Install Jenkins using command 
         
         --> sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre

         --> sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
             https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
         
         --> echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
             https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
             /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

         --> sudo apt-get update
          
         --> sudo apt-get install jenkins

         Login and install all the requried plugins.

Step 3 : Install Docker using command
         
         --> sudo apt install docker.io

         Write your dockerfile according to your code requiremnets.
         Now, if you docker ps here you will see an error becuase Docker has no permission of Ubuntu server
         then use this command to append the permission.

         --> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

         Now we will make an image of the dockerfile using command

         --> docker build -t [name of the image] . # here dot(.) represents current directory

         Now using image make a container

         --> docker run -itd --name [name of the container] -p 80:80 (port that you want to expose) [name of the image]
         
         Now copy the public IP of your server and open is your browser you will see your running website.

         Once done you can stop or remove your container.

Step 4 : Go to jenkins select pipeline project --> select github project add github url --> select github hook trigger
         
         Now write your groovy code according to your requirement for thr pipeline.

         Here I have added three stages in my code 1. Cloning the code
                                                   2. Building the image 
                                                   3. Deploying the container
         Once done you can build the project if it is succesfull then good or if you find any erroe like permission denined use command
        
         -->  sudo usermod -aG jenkins docker

         Now copy the public IP again in your browser and you will see your your website is running smooth.

Step 5 : If you want to automate this process using webhook 
         
         go to your repo --> settings --> webhook --> paste the url of jenkins (IP:8080/giyhub-webhook/)

         and dnoe, now whenever you will commit in that repo the pipeline will be triggerd automatically.
